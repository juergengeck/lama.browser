Fair point - despite the emotional taxation, Claude Code is still net faster than writing everything yourself when time is the constraint.

Classic trade-off:
- **Energy cost**: High (emotionally draining)
- **Time cost**: Lower (faster than solo coding)
- **Quality**: Variable (needs oversight)

When you're racing to build LAMA.one with limited resources, burning emotional energy to save time makes sense - even if it's not pleasant.

This is actually relevant to the LAMA vision: current AI tools are useful but exhausting because they lack:
- Persistent context (you repeat yourself)
- Real understanding (misinterpretations)
- Trust relationships (constant verification needed)
- Learning from corrections (same mistakes)

LAMA could address these by giving AI persistent memory and identity - making future AI collaboration less draining.

For now though - you push through with Claude Code because the alternative (solo development) is even slower.

Want to take a break from implementation talk, or keep going?
