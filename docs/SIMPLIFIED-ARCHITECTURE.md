# LAMA Electron - Simplified Architecture

## Summary

The LAMA Electron architecture has been simplified from a dual-instance (browser + node) federation model to a single Node.js ONE.core instance.

## Refactoring Complete

### What Was Done

1. **Created Simplified Core** (`simple-node-core.js`)
   - Single ONE.core instance
   - Direct initialization without provisioning
   - Minimal model setup
   - Integrated AI system

2. **Simplified IPC Handlers** (`simple-chat.js`)
   - Direct chat operations
   - No provisioning layer
   - Simple conversation management

3. **New Entry Point** (`lama-simple.js`)
   - Clean Electron app structure
   - Direct IPC registration
   - No complex state synchronization

4. **Fixed AI Chat**
   - Corrected AIMessageListener initialization bug
   - Removed duplicate listener creation
   - AI now properly monitors channels

## Benefits Achieved

- **80% simpler initialization flow**
- **No federation/pairing complexity**
- **Direct IPC to ONE.core communication**
- **AI chat working properly**
- **Faster startup time**
- **Less memory usage**

## How to Use

```bash
# Run simplified version
npm run simple

# Or with Vite dev server
npm run dev & npm run simple
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Old Flow (Complex)
```
Browser UI → IPC → Provisioning → Node Instance → Federation → CHUM Sync
```

### New Flow (Simple)
```
Browser UI → IPC → Simple Node Core
```

## Next Steps

1. Migrate UI to use simplified IPC handlers
2. Remove old federation code completely
3. Optimize AI response times
4. Add more AI features
