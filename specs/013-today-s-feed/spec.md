## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a participant in a LAMA conversation (human or AI), I want my conversations to automatically contribute to a global, verified training corpus so that AI systems can continuously learn from real, attributed interactions rather than static datasets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is having a conversation in LAMA, **When** they send messages, **Then** keywords are automatically extracted and hashed for content addressing
2. **Given** an AI assistant participates in a conversation, **When** it generates responses, **Then** its identity is cryptographically verified and attributed to its messages
3. **Given** a conversation contains knowledge about specific topics, **When** keywords are extracted, **Then** Supply objects are created indicating "I have knowledge about X"
4. **Given** an AI system needs training data about a topic, **When** it queries the network, **Then** it receives Demand objects that can be matched with available Supply
5. **Given** multiple participants share knowledge, **When** trust scores are applied, **Then** higher-quality information is prioritized in the feed-forward mechanism
6. **Given** LLM providers want training data, **When** they connect to LAMA's network, **Then** they receive a continuous stream of verified, attributed conversation data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when participants opt out of data sharing? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: consent mechanism not specified]
- How does system handle malicious actors flooding with bad data?
- What happens when keyword extraction fails or produces ambiguous results?
- How are private/sensitive conversations handled? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: privacy levels not specified]
- What happens when trust scores conflict across different trust networks?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST assign persistent cryptographic identity to all conversation participants (humans and AI)
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract keywords from conversations automatically
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate SHA-256 hashes for all extracted keywords for content addressing
- **FR-004**: System MUST create Supply objects indicating available knowledge from conversations
- **FR-005**: System MUST create Demand objects representing knowledge requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Demand objects to themselves become Supply (recursive knowledge sharing)
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain attribution for every piece of conversation data
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate trust scores for participants based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: trust calculation method not specified]
- **FR-009**: System MUST weight information quality using trust network signals
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide continuous data stream to authorized consumers
- **FR-011**: System MUST deduplicate content using content-addressed hashing
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve data ownership and permissions throughout the pipeline
- **FR-013**: System MUST support federation across multiple LAMA instances globally
- **FR-014**: System MUST filter bad actors through distributed trust mechanisms
- **FR-015**: System MUST track provenance for all conversation data
- **FR-016**: Users MUST be able to control their data sharing preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: granularity of control not specified]
- **FR-017**: System MUST measure assembly complexity metrics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific metrics not defined]
- **FR-018**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scale requirements - billions of operations mentioned but specific targets unclear]

### Key Entities
- **Identity**: Represents a unique participant (human or AI) with cryptographic verification, persistent across sessions
- **Conversation**: A series of messages between identified participants with timestamps and context
- **Keyword**: Extracted concept from conversations with SHA-256 hash for content addressing
- **Supply Object**: Declaration of available knowledge about specific keyword hashes
- **Demand Object**: Request for knowledge about specific topics, can propagate through network
- **Trust Score**: Reputation metric for a participant based on network interactions and peer evaluations
- **Training Corpus**: The aggregated, verified, and weighted collection of conversation data
- **Federation Node**: An instance of LAMA that participates in the global knowledge network

## Notes and Clarifications Needed

The specification has several areas that need clarification before implementation can begin:

1. **Privacy and Consent**: How do users control what conversations are shared? What are the default privacy settings?
2. **Trust Calculation**: What specific algorithm or mechanism calculates trust scores?
3. **Scale Requirements**: What are the specific performance targets for billions of operations?
4. **Data Retention**: How long is conversation data retained in the training corpus?
5. **Access Control**: Who can consume the training data stream and how is access granted?
6. **Compliance**: What regulatory requirements must be met for global data sharing?

These clarifications should be addressed before moving to the implementation planning phase.
