# Feature Specification: Memories in Topic-Based Chats

**Feature Branch**: `002-memories-live-in`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "memories live in one chats we call topics"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a LAMA user, I want my conversation memories to be organized within dedicated topic-based chats, so that related context and history are grouped together and easily accessible when discussing specific subjects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an existing conversation, **When** they discuss a specific topic, **Then** the memories from that conversation are stored within that topic's dedicated chat space
2. **Given** a user creates a new topic, **When** they start a conversation within that topic, **Then** all memories generated during that conversation are associated with that topic
3. **Given** a user has multiple topics with stored memories, **When** they switch between topics, **Then** they can access the specific memories associated with each topic
4. **Given** a user is in a topic-based chat, **When** they reference previous discussions, **Then** the system retrieves memories only from that specific topic context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user tries to merge memories from different topics]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: moving memories between topics]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: a topic is deleted - are memories deleted or archived]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory storage limits per topic]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create named topics for organizing conversations
- **FR-002**: System MUST store conversation memories within their associated topic context
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access memories specific to the currently active topic
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain memory isolation between different topics
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist topic-based memories across sessions
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: create new topics vs select from predefined topics]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of topics per user not specified]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory search functionality within topics not specified]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rename/edit topic names after creation not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory sharing between topics not specified - can memories be referenced across topics]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Topic**: A named container for organizing related conversations and their associated memories
- **Memory**: A piece of stored information from a conversation, belonging to a specific topic
- **Conversation**: A chat session that occurs within the context of a topic
