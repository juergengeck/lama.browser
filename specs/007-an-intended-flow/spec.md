# Feature Specification: Third-Party Message Audit Flow

**Feature Branch**: `007-an-intended-flow`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "an intended flow for audit is to 1) share a topic with an independent third party, 2) scan a qr code per message, 3) have the independent 3rd party from step 1 attest the correctness of a representation of the message referenced by the qr code"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: audit flow with third-party attestation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: message sender, independent third-party auditor
   ‚Üí Actions: share topic, generate QR codes, scan QR codes, attest messages
   ‚Üí Data: topics, messages, QR codes, attestations
   ‚Üí Constraints: third party must have topic access, message verification
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow established for audit process
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
   ‚Üí Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Topic, Message, QR Code, Attestation, Auditor
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: Spec has uncertainties requiring clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a message sender in LAMA, I want to enable independent third-party verification of my messages so that recipients or auditors can verify the authenticity and integrity of specific messages within a conversation topic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an active conversation topic with messages, **When** they share the topic with a third-party auditor, **Then** the auditor gains read-only access to all messages in that topic

2. **Given** a third-party auditor has access to a shared topic, **When** they scan a QR code associated with a specific message, **Then** they see the message content and can verify it matches what's in the shared topic

3. **Given** a third-party auditor has verified a message matches the QR code representation, **When** they create an attestation, **Then** the attestation is recorded and viewable by authorized parties

4. **Given** a message has been attested by an auditor, **When** any party views the message, **Then** they can see the attestation status and auditor identity

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a QR code is scanned by someone without topic access? ‚Üí They cannot access the content (only auditors and participants have access)
- How does system handle QR codes for edited/versioned messages? ‚Üí Each version gets its own QR code; attestations are version-specific
- What happens if an auditor's access to a topic is revoked after they've made attestations? ‚Üí Previous attestations remain valid
- How does system handle conflicting attestations from multiple auditors? ‚Üí All attestations are recorded; signatures may be incomplete for changed messages

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow either participant to share full topic content with designated third-party auditors
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate a unique QR code for each message version that can be displayed or exported
- **FR-003**: QR codes MUST contain a reference to retrieve the specific message version (not the full content)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow third-party auditors with topic access to scan message QR codes
- **FR-005**: System MUST display message content to auditors when they scan a valid QR code
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow auditors to create attestations confirming that a reproduced version is correct
- **FR-007**: Attestations MUST include auditor identity, timestamp, and a claim that the reproduced version matches the original
- **FR-008**: System MUST display attestation status on messages that have been verified
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain an immutable audit trail of all attestations
- **FR-010**: System MUST restrict attestation creation to auditors and participants only (those with topic content access)
- **FR-011**: QR codes MUST remain valid as long as message content is retained locally
- **FR-012**: System MUST support unlimited concurrent auditors (QR codes are immutable)
- **FR-013**: System MUST link attestations to specific message versions
- **FR-014**: System MUST indicate when signatures are incomplete for changed/edited messages

### Key Entities
- **Topic**: A conversation thread containing multiple messages that can be shared in full with auditors
- **Message Version**: Specific version of a message within a topic that requires verification
- **Auditor**: Third-party entity with full topic content access and attestation privileges
- **QR Code**: Machine-readable reference linking to a specific message version (immutable)
- **Attestation**: Cryptographically signed statement from an auditor confirming a reproduced version is correct
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable record of all version-specific attestations for compliance and verification

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
