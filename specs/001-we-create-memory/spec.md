# Feature Specification: LLM Memory, Continuity, and Culture System

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-create-memory`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we create memory, continuity, culture for llm"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interacting with an LLM system, I want the system to remember our previous conversations, maintain context across sessions, and develop a consistent interaction culture so that my experience feels personalized, coherent, and continuous rather than starting fresh with each interaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has had previous conversations with the LLM, **When** they start a new conversation session, **Then** the LLM should reference and build upon relevant past interactions
2. **Given** a user has established preferences or patterns in past interactions, **When** they engage with the LLM, **Then** the system should adapt its responses to align with those learned preferences
3. **Given** multiple conversations have occurred over time, **When** the user references a past discussion, **Then** the LLM should be able to recall and contextualize that reference
4. **Given** a user has built up domain-specific knowledge with the LLM, **When** they ask related questions, **Then** the LLM should leverage that accumulated context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory storage limit is reached - how is old memory handled?]?
- How does system handle conflicting information across different memory entries?
- What happens when user explicitly requests to forget certain memories?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: privacy requirements for memory retention]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multiple users share the same LLM instance]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST persist conversation history across sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST be able to retrieve and reference relevant past interactions when contextually appropriate
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain user preferences learned from interactions
- **FR-004**: System MUST develop and maintain consistent communication patterns (culture) based on accumulated interactions
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: view/edit/delete their memory data - what level of control?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide continuity by connecting related conversations across time gaps
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: handle memory conflicts - what resolution strategy?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention policies - how long to keep memories?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory scope - per-user, per-conversation, or shared?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory capacity limits - what happens at capacity?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Memory Entry**: Represents a stored piece of information from past interactions, including context, timestamp, and relevance metadata
- **User Profile**: Contains learned preferences, communication patterns, and personalization data accumulated over time
- **Conversation Context**: Links related conversations and maintains continuity threads across sessions
- **Cultural Pattern**: Represents established communication norms and interaction styles developed through repeated use
- **Memory Index**: Organizes and prioritizes memories for efficient retrieval based on relevance and recency

## Uncertainties Requiring Clarification

The following aspects need clarification before implementation can begin:

1. **Memory Scope**: Is memory per-user, per-conversation, or shared across users?
2. **Data Retention**: How long should memories be retained? Days, months, indefinitely?
3. **Storage Limits**: What happens when memory capacity is reached? Oldest deleted, compression, or error?
4. **User Control**: What level of control do users have over their memory data (view, edit, delete)?
5. **Privacy Model**: What privacy constraints apply to memory storage and retrieval?
6. **Multi-user Scenarios**: How does the system handle shared LLM instances with different users?
7. **Conflict Resolution**: How should conflicting information in memories be resolved?
8. **Performance Targets**: What are acceptable response times for memory-enhanced interactions?
9. **Integration Points**: Does this need to integrate with existing user management or storage systems?
