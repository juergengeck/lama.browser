# Feature Specification: TypeScript Code Quality and Type Safety Restoration

**Feature Branch**: `014-there-are-typescript`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "there are typescript errors. do a proper code review and refactor the broken parts."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on LAMA Electron, I need a codebase that compiles without type errors so that I can confidently build, test, and deploy the application without runtime type-related failures.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer runs the build process, **When** the compilation step executes, **Then** the build completes successfully with zero type errors
2. **Given** a developer runs type checking, **When** executing the type check command, **Then** all files pass validation without type errors
3. **Given** a developer works in their IDE, **When** they open any project file, **Then** no type errors are displayed in the editor
4. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs, **When** it performs type checking, **Then** the pipeline passes without type-related failures
5. **Given** a developer imports a module, **When** they use its exports, **Then** all types are properly inferred and available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external dependencies have incomplete type definitions?
- How does system handle migration of JavaScript files to TypeScript?
- What occurs when type definitions conflict between different versions of dependencies?
- How should dynamic imports and runtime type assertions be handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST compile successfully without any TypeScript errors
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality after refactoring
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide proper type definitions for all public APIs and exports
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle null/undefined values safely with appropriate type guards
- **FR-005**: System MUST resolve all import path and module resolution issues
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all function calls match their expected signatures
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide type safety for inter-process communication (IPC) handlers
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain type consistency across main process and renderer process boundaries
- **FR-009**: Code review MUST identify architectural issues causing type problems
- **FR-010**: Refactoring MUST follow established project patterns and conventions
- **FR-011**: System MUST retain all current business logic and features after refactoring
- **FR-012**: Development environment MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which IDE integrations - VSCode, WebStorm, others?]
- **FR-013**: Type checking MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time limit for type checking?]
- **FR-014**: Refactored code MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance benchmarks?]
- **FR-015**: Code quality MUST meet [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific code quality metrics or standards?]

### Key Entities
- **Type Definitions**: Interfaces, types, and enums that define the shape of data throughout the application
- **Module Boundaries**: Clear separation between main process, renderer process, and shared code
- **API Contracts**: Type-safe interfaces between different parts of the system (IPC, external APIs, libraries)
- **Dependency Types**: Type definitions from external packages and their compatibility with the project
