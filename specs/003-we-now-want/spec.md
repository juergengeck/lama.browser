# Feature Specification: AI Topic Summarization and Keyword Extraction

**Feature Branch**: `003-we-now-want`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we now want ai assistant to orchestrate the creation of summaries and key word extraction from topics where ai are participants. we need a Keyword datatype and a Summary datatype in a new package one.ai"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user participating in conversations with AI assistants, I want the AI to automatically generate summaries and extract keywords from our conversation topics so that I can quickly understand the essence of past discussions and find relevant conversations through keyword search.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a conversation topic with AI participants, **When** the conversation reaches [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: trigger point - message count, time elapsed, manual request?], **Then** the AI generates a concise summary of the topic and extracts relevant keywords
2. **Given** an AI-generated summary exists for a topic, **When** a user views the conversation, **Then** they can see the summary and associated keywords
3. **Given** keywords have been extracted from multiple topics, **When** a user searches for a keyword, **Then** they can find all topics containing that keyword
4. **Given** a conversation is ongoing, **When** significant new content is added, **Then** the AI updates the summary and keywords to reflect the new information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple AI assistants are in the same conversation?
- How does system handle conversations with mixed languages?
- What occurs when a conversation has minimal content (e.g., just greetings)?
- How are keywords handled when they conflict with user privacy preferences?
- What happens if summary generation fails due to content length or complexity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically generate summaries for conversation topics that include AI participants
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract relevant keywords from conversations with AI participants
- **FR-003**: Generated summaries MUST capture the main points and conclusions of the conversation
- **FR-004**: Keywords MUST be searchable across all conversations
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view summaries and keywords for any topic they have access to
- **FR-006**: System MUST update summaries when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update frequency - real-time, periodic, on-demand?]
- **FR-007**: Keywords MUST be limited to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of keywords per topic?]
- **FR-008**: Summaries MUST be limited to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum length/word count?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle multiple AI participants by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: consolidating their contributions, separate summaries per AI?]
- **FR-010**: Generated content MUST respect [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: privacy settings, data retention policies?]
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: edit/approve/reject AI-generated summaries and keywords?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which languages for summarization?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Summary**: A concise representation of a conversation topic's content, including main points, conclusions, and decisions made
- **Keyword**: A significant term or phrase extracted from a conversation that represents key concepts discussed
- **Topic**: An existing conversation thread that may include AI and human participants
- **AI Participant**: An artificial intelligence assistant that contributes to conversations and orchestrates summarization

## Clarifications Needed

The following aspects require clarification before implementation can begin:

1. **Trigger Mechanism**: When should summaries be generated? (After X messages, time-based, on-demand, or combination?)
2. **Update Frequency**: How often should existing summaries be updated as conversations continue?
3. **Content Limits**: What are the maximum lengths for summaries and number of keywords per topic?
4. **Multiple AI Handling**: How should the system handle conversations with multiple AI participants?
5. **User Control**: Can users edit, approve, or reject AI-generated summaries and keywords?
6. **Privacy and Retention**: What privacy settings apply to generated summaries and keywords?
7. **Language Support**: Which languages should be supported for summarization and keyword extraction?
8. **Search Scope**: Should keyword search be global across all users' topics or limited to individual user's conversations?
9. **Historical Data**: Should the system process existing conversations retroactively?
10. **Quality Metrics**: How will the quality of summaries and keyword relevance be measured or validated?
