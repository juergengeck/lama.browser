# Feature Specification: Chat Keywords Word Cloud

**Feature Branch**: `006-current-keywords-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "current Keywords for the current chat should be shown at the top of the chat in a horizontally scrollable word cloud. the maximum number of lines used must be configurable in settings, with one line as default."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user engaged in a chat conversation, I want to see the most relevant keywords from the current conversation displayed at the top of the chat window in a visually distinct word cloud format, so that I can quickly understand the main topics being discussed without scrolling through the entire conversation history.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is in an active chat conversation with at least 5 messages, **When** they view the chat window, **Then** they see a word cloud displaying the extracted keywords at the top of the chat area
2. **Given** the word cloud contains more keywords than fit in the visible area, **When** the user interacts with the word cloud area, **Then** they can horizontally scroll to see all keywords
3. **Given** a user wants to adjust the display size of the word cloud, **When** they navigate to settings and change the "Maximum word cloud lines" option, **Then** the word cloud immediately reflects this change in all chat windows
4. **Given** a new message is added to the chat, **When** the message contains new significant keywords, **Then** the word cloud updates to include these keywords [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update frequency - real-time, delayed, or on-demand?]
5. **Given** the word cloud is set to use one line (default), **When** keywords exceed the horizontal space, **Then** the overflow keywords are accessible via horizontal scrolling

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a chat has no messages or too few messages to extract meaningful keywords?
- How does system handle very long individual keywords that might overflow the display?
- What is the behavior when all messages in a chat are very short (e.g., "yes", "no", "ok")?
- How are keywords prioritized when there are more keywords than can reasonably fit even with scrolling?
- What happens when the user rapidly switches between different chat conversations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use the existing Keyword objects that the system generates for each conversation
- **FR-002**: System MUST display keywords in a word cloud format at the top of the chat window
- **FR-003**: Keywords MUST be displayed with consistent sizing following the app theme
- **FR-004**: Word cloud MUST support horizontal scrolling when keywords exceed the visible width
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to configure the maximum number of lines used by the word cloud in application settings
- **FR-006**: Default configuration MUST set the word cloud to use one line
- **FR-007**: Word cloud MUST update when the system's Keyword objects are updated for the conversation
- **FR-008**: Keywords MUST be ordered by relevance score from the existing Keyword generation system
- **FR-009**: Word cloud MUST be visible for all chat types that generate Keyword objects
- **FR-010**: System MUST display all Keywords that fit within the configured line count, with horizontal scrolling for overflow
- **FR-011**: Word cloud MUST use uniform font size consistent with the standard app theme
- **FR-012**: Settings MUST be persisted in the AI assistant configuration and apply to all chat windows

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Keyword**: The existing system-generated Keyword objects that contain extracted terms and their relevance scores
- **Word Cloud Configuration**: User preference stored in AI assistant settings, includes maximum lines setting (default: 1)
- **Chat Context**: The current conversation from which keywords are extracted, includes all messages and metadata needed for keyword extraction

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Interactive keywords (click to filter, copy, etc.) - planned for future iteration

## Uncertainties Requiring Clarification

All initial uncertainties have been resolved:

1. ~~**Keyword Extraction Method**: How should keywords be determined?~~ **RESOLVED**: System will use existing Keyword objects
2. ~~**Visual Representation**: How should font sizes map to relevance scores?~~ **RESOLVED**: Uniform font size, ordered by relevance
3. ~~**Update Triggers**: When should the word cloud refresh?~~ **RESOLVED**: When system's Keyword objects are updated
4. ~~**Chat Scope**: Which types of chats should display keywords?~~ **RESOLVED**: All chats that generate Keyword objects
5. ~~**Display Limits**: Maximum number of keywords to display?~~ **RESOLVED**: All that fit in configured lines with horizontal scroll
6. ~~**Font Size Range**: Minimum and maximum font sizes?~~ **RESOLVED**: Follow standard app theme sizing
7. ~~**Persistence**: Should settings persist?~~ **RESOLVED**: Settings persist in AI assistant configuration
8. ~~**Interaction**: Should keywords be clickable?~~ **RESOLVED**: Interactive features will be added in future iteration
