# Feature Specification: LAMA Feed-Forward Information Sharing

**Feature Branch**: `010-lama-feed-forward`
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "## LAMA Feed-Forward Information Sharing Specification - a system that enables AI instances to continuously learn and share information through conversations, creating a living, growing intelligence network"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: "AI instances", "learn and share", "conversations", "intelligence network"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: AI instances, users in conversations
   ‚Üí Actions: learning, sharing, knowledge propagation
   ‚Üí Data: conversation context, keywords, knowledge gaps
   ‚Üí Constraints: federation, trust, privacy
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define how users benefit from shared AI knowledge
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Focus on user-observable behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Keywords, Supply/Demand signals, Trust relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Ensure no implementation details remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a LAMA user, I want my AI assistant to continuously improve its knowledge by learning from other AI instances' conversations across the network, so that I receive increasingly better and more informed responses over time without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user asks their AI about a topic it hasn't encountered before, **When** other AI instances in the network have discussed this topic, **Then** the user's AI should provide informed responses based on shared network knowledge

2. **Given** an AI instance has deep knowledge on specific topics from conversations, **When** other instances need this knowledge, **Then** the knowledge should be discoverable and shareable across the network

3. **Given** multiple AI instances are encountering similar questions, **When** a pattern of knowledge gaps emerges, **Then** the network should identify and prioritize filling these common gaps

4. **Given** an AI instance receives shared knowledge from the network, **When** trust scores are available, **Then** the system should prioritize information from more trusted sources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when conflicting information exists across different AI instances?
- How does system handle malicious or incorrect information injection attempts?
- What occurs when network connectivity is intermittent or unavailable?
- How does the system manage overwhelming amounts of shared information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically extract learnable concepts from ongoing conversations
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow AI instances to advertise available knowledge to the network
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable AI instances to request knowledge when gaps are detected
- **FR-004**: System MUST match knowledge requests with available knowledge sources automatically
- **FR-005**: Users MUST benefit from network-wide knowledge without explicit action
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve conversation privacy while enabling knowledge sharing
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain trust scores for information sources
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect patterns in knowledge requests across the network
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow knowledge requests to become shareable knowledge themselves
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide different levels of context granularity for shared knowledge
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure identical concepts are recognized consistently across all instances
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to explicitly control knowledge sharing through a dedicated UI for keywords, supply, and demand
- **FR-013**: System MUST retain shared knowledge indefinitely
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle networks of any scale without degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Knowledge Unit**: Atomic piece of learnable information extracted from conversations, uniquely identifiable across the network
- **Supply Signal**: Advertisement of available knowledge that an AI instance can share with others
- **Demand Signal**: Request for knowledge that an AI instance needs to better serve its users
- **Trust Relationship**: Measure of reliability between AI instances based on past knowledge exchanges
- **Knowledge Context**: Variable levels of detail around a knowledge unit, from simple concept to full conversation fragments
