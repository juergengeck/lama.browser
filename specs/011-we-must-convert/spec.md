# Feature Specification: TypeScript Migration for LAMA Electron

**Feature Branch**: `011-we-must-convert`
**Created**: January 28, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we must convert this whole codebase to typescript"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: "convert whole codebase to typescript"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: convert, migrate, refactor
   ‚Üí Data: existing JavaScript code, type definitions
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain functionality, gradual migration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: migration approach - big-bang or incremental?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: strictness level for TypeScript config?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeline/priority for different modules?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow for adding new features in TypeScript
   ‚Üí Build process validation
   ‚Üí Runtime compatibility testing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each module must be convertible
   ‚Üí Type safety must be enforced
   ‚Üí Build system must support mixed JS/TS
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Main process modules (Node.js/CommonJS)
   ‚Üí Renderer process modules (Browser/ESM)
   ‚Üí Shared types and interfaces
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - migration approach needs definition"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on LAMA Electron, I want the codebase to be in TypeScript so that I can catch type-related bugs at compile time, have better IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring tools, and maintain a more robust and scalable codebase.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer is adding a new feature, **When** they write code with type errors, **Then** the build system catches these errors before runtime
2. **Given** a developer is refactoring existing code, **When** they change a function signature, **Then** all calling code shows type errors immediately
3. **Given** the application is running, **When** all modules have been converted, **Then** the application maintains all existing functionality
4. **Given** a developer is debugging, **When** they hover over a variable, **Then** they see complete type information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when third-party libraries don't have type definitions?
- How does system handle gradual migration with mixed JS/TS files?
- What happens to dynamic code patterns that don't fit TypeScript's type system?
- How are CommonJS/ESM module differences handled during conversion?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality after TypeScript conversion
- **FR-002**: System MUST support incremental migration allowing JS and TS files to coexist
- **FR-003**: Build system MUST compile TypeScript to JavaScript for both main and renderer processes
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide type definitions for all public APIs and interfaces
- **FR-005**: System MUST catch type errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **FR-006**: IDE MUST provide IntelliSense/autocomplete for all converted modules
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing ONE.core JavaScript APIs
- **FR-008**: Migration approach MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: big-bang conversion or incremental by module?]
- **FR-009**: TypeScript configuration MUST use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: strict mode or allow gradual strictness?]
- **FR-010**: Module conversion priority MUST follow [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which modules first - critical path or leaf modules?]

### Key Entities
- **Main Process Modules**: Node.js environment modules using CommonJS, handling IPC, file system, and ONE.core integration
- **Renderer Process Modules**: Browser environment React components and utilities using ES modules
- **IPC Interface Types**: Type definitions for all IPC channels and their payloads between main and renderer
- **ONE.core Type Definitions**: External type definitions or declarations for ONE.core library interfaces
- **Shared Types**: Common types used across both main and renderer processes
