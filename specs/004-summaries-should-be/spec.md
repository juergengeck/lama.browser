# Feature Specification: Dynamic Summary and Keyword Updates

**Feature Branch**: `004-summaries-should-be`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "summaries should be updated when new messages become available. the ai in the default chat should create new keywords from the context of the chat with the new message and create a new summary if the context has changed, i.e. if the llm determines that the previous summary under the keyword lacks information. if the summary is new then keyword and summary are stored. the Keyword parameter is isId for the Summary object."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user chatting with AI assistants, I want summaries and keywords to automatically update as the conversation evolves, so that the summaries remain accurate and comprehensive, reflecting new information and context changes as they occur.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing chat with AI that has summaries and keywords, **When** a new message is added to the conversation, **Then** the AI evaluates whether the context has changed significantly and updates summaries accordingly
2. **Given** a conversation where context has shifted, **When** the AI determines the existing summary lacks important new information, **Then** a new summary is created and stored with appropriate keywords
3. **Given** a conversation with existing keywords, **When** new messages introduce novel concepts, **Then** the AI generates additional keywords to capture the expanded context
4. **Given** multiple summaries exist for different keywords in a conversation, **When** new content relates to specific keywords, **Then** only the relevant summary associated with that keyword is updated
5. **Given** a keyword serves as an identifier for a summary, **When** accessing summaries, **Then** users can retrieve specific summaries using their associated keywords

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a conversation rapidly shifts between multiple unrelated topics?
- How does the system handle conflicting information between old and new messages?
- What occurs when the AI cannot determine if context has changed significantly?
- How are summaries handled when messages are deleted or edited?
- What happens if keyword generation produces duplicates or near-duplicates?
- How does the system manage storage when conversations generate many summaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST monitor new messages in conversations with AI participants
- **FR-002**: AI MUST evaluate whether new messages represent a significant context change
- **FR-003**: System MUST create new summaries when the AI determines existing summaries lack important information
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate keywords based on the conversation context including new messages
- **FR-005**: Each keyword MUST serve as a unique identifier for its associated summary
- **FR-006**: System MUST store new summaries and keywords when created
- **FR-007**: Summaries MUST accurately reflect the current state of the conversation including recent messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: version history of summaries or only latest version?]
- **FR-009**: AI evaluation of context changes MUST occur within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: time constraint for processing?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of summaries per conversation?]
- **FR-011**: Keywords MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: globally unique or unique within a conversation?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notify users when summaries are updated?]
- **FR-013**: Summary updates MUST preserve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: relationship to previous summaries or standalone?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Keyword**: A unique identifier that represents a concept or topic within a conversation and serves as the reference key for accessing summaries
- **Summary**: A concise representation of conversation content associated with a specific keyword, containing the essential information and context
- **Message**: Individual communication units in a conversation that trigger evaluation for summary updates
- **Context**: The semantic meaning and relationships between messages that the AI evaluates to determine if summaries need updating
- **AI Assistant**: The intelligent agent responsible for evaluating context changes and generating summaries and keywords

## Clarifications Needed

The following aspects require clarification before implementation can begin:

1. **Summary Versioning**: Should the system maintain a history of summary versions or only keep the latest version?
2. **Processing Time**: What is the acceptable time limit for the AI to evaluate context and generate updates?
3. **Storage Limits**: Is there a maximum number of summaries allowed per conversation?
4. **Keyword Uniqueness**: Should keywords be globally unique across all conversations or unique only within each conversation?
5. **User Notifications**: Should users be notified when summaries are updated, and if so, how?
6. **Summary Relationships**: Should updated summaries maintain links to previous versions or be standalone?
7. **Context Evaluation Threshold**: What constitutes a "significant" context change that warrants a new summary?
8. **Concurrent Updates**: How should the system handle multiple messages arriving simultaneously?
9. **Error Recovery**: What happens if summary generation fails or produces invalid results?
10. **Default Chat Scope**: Does "default chat" refer to all chats or a specific type of conversation?
