# Specification Quality Checklist: Browser Platform Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items passed on first validation (2025-10-18).

### Content Quality Assessment

- **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT users need (browser access, message sending, data persistence, P2P sync) without specifying HOW to implement (no specific libraries, code structure, or APIs mentioned in requirements)
- **User value focus**: All user stories describe value from user perspective (browser access, messaging, data persistence, P2P connections)
- **Non-technical language**: Spec readable by business stakeholders - avoids technical jargon in requirements and success criteria
- **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, and Scope all populated

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are clear and complete
- **Testable requirements**: Every FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001: "System MUST run ONE.core in Web Worker" - testable by checking worker execution)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC entries include specific metrics (e.g., SC-002: "within 5 seconds", SC-006: "within 3 seconds")
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: SC entries describe user outcomes without implementation details (e.g., "loads within 5 seconds" not "IndexedDB query completes in 5 seconds")
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 4 prioritized user stories with Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases covering storage limits, security policies, worker support, multi-tab, tab closure, browser extensions
- **Scope bounded**: Clear In Scope and Out of Scope sections with 11 in-scope items and 8 out-of-scope items
- **Dependencies identified**: Technical, External, and Assumptions sections all populated

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is independently verifiable and atomic
- **Primary flows covered**: P1-P4 user stories cover: browser access (P1), messaging (P2), persistence (P3), P2P sync (P4)
- **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria with specific metrics
- **No implementation leakage**: Spec remains focused on user needs and outcomes, not technical implementation

## Notes

**Update 2025-10-18 (1)**: Corrected transport mechanism from WebRTC to commserver (WebSocket relay). All references to WebRTC have been replaced with commserver throughout the specification.

**Update 2025-10-18 (2)**: Clarified that ONE.core already has built-in browser platform support with IndexedDB storage and WebSocket transport at `./packages/one.core/lib/system/browser` (local package). Updated specification to reflect that we're using existing ONE.core capabilities rather than building new adapters.

**Update 2025-10-18 (3)**: Added references to local package structure (`./packages/one.core` and `./packages/one.models`) to clarify dependencies are local packages in the monorepo.

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No issues requiring updates.
