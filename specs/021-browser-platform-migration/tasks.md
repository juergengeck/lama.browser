# Tasks: Browser Platform Migration

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/gecko/src/lama/lama.browser/specs/021-browser-platform-migration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not included in this implementation plan unless explicitly requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: Main thread UI in `browser-ui/`, Worker backend in `worker/`, Shared types in `shared/`
- Current Electron structure in `main/` and `electron-ui/` will be migrated

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Browser Access) - Priority P1 - MVP candidate
  - US2 (Messaging) - Priority P2 - Depends on US1 for UI infrastructure
  - US3 (Storage) - Priority P3 - Independent of US1/US2
  - US4 (Sync) - Priority P4 - Depends on US2 for messaging infrastructure
- **Feature Parity (Phase 7-9)**: Can start after US1 completes, run in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses UI infrastructure from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses messaging from US2 but independently testable
- **Topic Analysis**: Can start after US1 - Independent feature
- **Proposals**: Can start after US1 - Independent feature
- **MCP**: Can start after US1 - Independent feature

### Within Each User Story

- Message handlers before UI updates
- Worker services before message handlers
- ONE.core initialization before any storage operations
- Worker client implementation before UI hook updates
- Error handling and validation throughout

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All tasks (T001-T007) can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: Tasks T009-T017 can run in parallel after T008 (worker entry point)
- **User Story 1**: Tasks T018-T022 can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T031-T035 can run in parallel (worker handlers and services)
- **User Story 3**: Tasks T044-T048 can run in parallel (storage handlers and monitoring)
- **User Story 4**: Tasks T058-T064 can run in parallel (connection handlers and services)
- **Feature Parity Phases**: All three phases (7-9) can run in parallel once US1 is complete
- **Polish Phase**: Most tasks (T094-T103) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all message handlers for User Story 1 together:

Task: "Implement onecore:getStatus message handler in worker/messages/one-core.ts"
Task: "Implement chat:getTopics message handler in worker/messages/chat.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all worker services for User Story 2 together:

Task: "Implement chat:sendMessage message handler in worker/messages/chat.ts"
Task: "Implement ai:chat message handler in worker/messages/ai.ts"
Task: "Migrate AI assistant initialization to worker in worker/core/ai-assistant-model.ts"
Task: "Migrate LLM manager to worker in worker/services/llm-manager.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T017) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018-T030)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Open browser, verify app loads, conversations display, navigation works
5. Deploy to web server for browser access

**MVP Deliverable**: Users can access LAMA via browser URL without desktop installation. The application loads, displays conversations, and handles navigation. This proves the core platform migration works.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T017) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T018-T030) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (T031-T043) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Messaging works!)
4. Add User Story 3 (T044-T057) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Data persists!)
5. Add User Story 4 (T058-T072) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Sync works!)
6. Add Feature Parity (T073-T093) ‚Üí Complete feature set ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add Polish (T094-T109) ‚Üí Production ready ‚Üí Final deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T017)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Browser Access)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Storage) - Independent of US1
   - Developer C: Topic Analysis - Can start when US1 UI exists
3. **After US1 completes**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Messaging)
   - Developer D: Proposals - Can run parallel with US2
4. **After US2 completes**:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Sync)
   - Developer E: MCP Integration
5. **Final phase**: All developers on Polish tasks (parallel)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance target: Worker init <5s, message latency <50ms, storage ops <100ms read/<200ms write
- Browser targets: Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+ (90% market share)
- Critical: ONE.core browser platform (`lib/system/browser/`) provides IndexedDB + WebSocket abstractions
- Storage: IndexedDB with relaxed durability for 344% performance improvement
- Transport: WebSocket only via commserver (no direct P2P in browser)
- Avoid: Electron-specific APIs, Node.js file system, Node.js crypto (use WebCrypto)

**Total Tasks**: 109 tasks
- Setup: 7 tasks
- Foundational: 10 tasks (BLOCKING)
- User Story 1: 13 tasks (MVP)
- User Story 2: 13 tasks
- User Story 3: 14 tasks
- User Story 4: 15 tasks
- Topic Analysis: 8 tasks
- Proposals: 7 tasks
- MCP: 6 tasks
- Polish: 16 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 67 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other tasks
**MVP Scope**: Setup (7) + Foundational (10) + User Story 1 (13) = 30 tasks
