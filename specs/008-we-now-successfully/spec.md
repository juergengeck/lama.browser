# Feature Specification: HTML Export with Microdata Markup

**Feature Branch**: `008-we-now-successfully`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we now successfully export markdown from the chat. our standard format it html with microdata markup, which we need to include hashes and signatures. so we must add an alternative export of html with comprehensive embedded markup"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a LAMA user, I need to export chat conversations in HTML format with comprehensive microdata markup that includes cryptographic hashes and signatures, so that I can preserve the authenticity and integrity of my conversations in a standard web format that can be verified and validated externally.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a chat conversation with messages, **When** user selects HTML export with microdata, **Then** system generates an HTML file containing all messages with embedded microdata including hashes and signatures
2. **Given** an exported HTML file with microdata, **When** the file is viewed in a browser, **Then** the conversation displays correctly with all formatting preserved
3. **Given** an exported HTML file with microdata, **When** a verification tool reads the microdata, **Then** it can extract and verify hashes and signatures for each message
4. **Given** the existing markdown export option, **When** user views export options, **Then** both markdown and HTML with microdata options are available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a message contains HTML special characters that need escaping?
- How does system handle messages without signatures (e.g., system messages)?
- What happens when exporting very large conversations with thousands of messages?
- How does the system handle messages with attachments or embedded media?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an HTML export option alongside the existing markdown export
- **FR-002**: Exported HTML MUST include microdata markup for each message containing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact microdata schema/vocabulary to use - schema.org, custom schema?]
- **FR-003**: Each message's microdata MUST include the message hash
- **FR-004**: Each message's microdata MUST include the digital signature [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what signature format/algorithm - cryptographic signature from ONE.core?]
- **FR-005**: HTML export MUST preserve all message formatting (bold, italic, code blocks, links)
- **FR-006**: Exported HTML MUST be self-contained and viewable in any modern web browser
- **FR-007**: System MUST include metadata about the conversation (participants, date range, topic) in the HTML
- **FR-008**: Microdata markup MUST be machine-readable for external verification tools
- **FR-009**: Export process MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements for large conversations - max size, timeout?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST sanitize user content to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in exported HTML

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Exported HTML Document**: Complete HTML file with embedded conversation data and microdata markup
- **Message Microdata**: Structured data for each message including content, timestamp, author, hash, and signature
- **Conversation Metadata**: Header information about the chat including participants, topic, and date range
- **Cryptographic Elements**: Hashes and signatures embedded as microdata properties for verification
